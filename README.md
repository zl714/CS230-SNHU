The Gaming Room is a company that builds online games. They wanted us to design a system to manage multiple instances of their game, Draw It or Lose It, across different platforms without causing conflicts. The software needed to handle game sessions and make sure everything runs smoothly on devices like phones and computers.
One thing I did well in the documentation was clearly laying out the system’s structure and explaining why I made certain design choices. It helped make the project easier to understand.
Writing the design document before coding was very helpful. It made me think through the big picture and avoid confusion when it came time to actually build the software.
If I could go back and change something, I would improve the risk section by giving more detailed ideas for how to handle possible problems.
I made sure to focus on what the user needed, like avoiding duplicate games and keeping things simple across platforms. It’s important because if the software doesn’t meet the user’s needs, it won’t be successful no matter how good the code is.
When designing the software, I broke down the project into smaller parts, used diagrams to plan things out, and thought about common design patterns. In the future, I would keep using these strategies to stay organized and build better software.
